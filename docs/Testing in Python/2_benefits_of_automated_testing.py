1. Fast: Run all tests with one command
"""

## Without Tests (Manual Testing)
# Imagine you're building an e-commerce website with these functions:

def calculate_tax(price, tax_rate):
    return price * tax_rate

def apply_discount(price, discount_percent):
    return price * (1 - discount_percent / 100)

def calculate_shipping(weight, distance):
    base_rate = 5.0
    return base_rate + (weight * 0.5) + (distance * 0.1)

def calculate_total(price, tax_rate, discount_percent, weight, distance):
    discounted_price = apply_discount(price, discount_percent)
    tax = calculate_tax(discounted_price, tax_rate)
    shipping = calculate_shipping(weight, distance)
    return discounted_price + tax + shipping

# Manual testing process every time you make a change:
# You'd have to run this manually every single time
print("Testing calculate_tax...")
print(f"Tax on $100 at 8.5%: ${calculate_tax(100, 0.085)}")  # Check: should be $8.50
print(f"Tax on $50 at 10%: ${calculate_tax(50, 0.10)}")      # Check: should be $5.00

print("Testing apply_discount...")
print(f"20% off $100: ${apply_discount(100, 20)}")           # Check: should be $80.00
print(f"50% off $200: ${apply_discount(200, 50)}")           # Check: should be $100.00

print("Testing calculate_shipping...")
print(f"5lbs, 100 miles: ${calculate_shipping(5, 100)}")     # Check: should be $17.50

print("Testing calculate_total...")
# This gets complicated - you have to manually verify this math
print(f"Full order: ${calculate_total(100, 0.085, 20, 5, 100)}")

# Time estimate: 5-10 minutes of manual checking each time



## With Automated Tests

# Run ALL tests with: python -m unittest test_ecommerce.py
# Time: ~0.1 seconds

# The difference:
#   - Manual: 5-10 minutes every time you change something
#   - Automated: 0.1 seconds to run ALL tests
#   - Real impact: If you change code 20 times per day, that's 2-3 hours saved daily!

2. Reliable: Tests run exactly the same way every time

## The Problem with Manual Testing
# When testing manually, humans make mistakes:

# Day 1: You test carefully
print("Testing discount function...")
result = apply_discount(100, 20)
print(f"Result: {result}")  # You carefully check: "80.0, looks good!"

# Day 15: You're tired and rushing
result = apply_discount(100, 20)
print(f"Result: {result}")  # You glance quickly: "80-something, good enough"
# But what if there was actually a bug that made it return 79.99?
# You might miss it when you're tired or distracted

# Day 30: You forgot to test this function entirely
# You only tested the "happy path" and missed edge cases 


## Automated Tests Are Always Exact
class TestReliability(unittest.TestCase):
    
    def test_discount_precision(self):
        """This test will ALWAYS catch if the result is even 0.01 off"""
        result = apply_discount(100, 20)
        self.assertEqual(result, 80.0)  # Must be EXACTLY 80.0
        
        # It will also test the same edge cases every single time
        self.assertEqual(apply_discount(99.99, 15), 84.9915)  # Precise to 4 decimal places
        self.assertEqual(apply_discount(0, 50), 0.0)          # Zero case
        self.assertEqual(apply_discount(100, 0), 100.0)       # No discount case

# Real-world example:
# A developer once manually tested a payment system and always tested with round numbers like $100, $50. 
# The automated tests caught that payments of $99.99 were being rounded incorrectly, causing customers to be 
# overcharged by pennies. Manual testing missed this because humans tend to test "nice" numbers.

## Manual Testing Limitations

"""
# Summary: The Compound Effect

Each benefit multiplies the others:

## Week 1 without tests:
- Spend 2 hours manually testing after each change
- Miss 3 bugs that make it to production
- Afraid to refactor messy code
- New team member takes days to understand how functions work

## Week 1 with tests:
- Spend 5 minutes writing tests, 5 seconds running them
- Catch 5 bugs before they reach production
- Confidently refactor code knowing tests will catch any mistakes
- New team member reads tests and understands the codebase in hours

The result: More reliable software, faster development, happier developers, and happier users.
Tests aren't just about finding bugs - they're about giving you superpowers as a developer!

🚀 Fast: Instead of spending hours manually checking your code every time you make a change, you run one command and get results in seconds. This adds up to saving hours every day.
🎯 Reliable: Computers don't get tired, distracted, or forget to test edge cases like humans do. They catch the subtle bugs that manual testing often misses.
🔍 Comprehensive: You can easily test dozens of scenarios (including weird edge cases) that you'd never think to test manually or would skip due to time constraints.
💪 Confidence: This is huge - you can make changes fearlessly knowing that if you break something, you'll know immediately. No more "deploy and pray" situations.
📚 Documentation: Your tests become living examples of how your code should be used. They're always up-to-date because if they're wrong, the tests fail!
The most important insight is that these benefits compound. When you're confident your changes won't break things (because tests will catch it), you're willing to improve your code more often. When you can test quickly, you experiment more. When you have comprehensive tests, you catch bugs earlier when they're cheaper to fix.

This is why experienced developers often say "I write tests to go faster, not slower." The upfront time investment pays massive dividends.
