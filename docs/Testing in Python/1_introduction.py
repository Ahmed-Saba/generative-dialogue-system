# ==========================================================================================================
# Testing in Python
# ==========================================================================================================

## What Are Tests?
Tests are pieces of code that automatically check if your main code works correctly. Think of them as 
quality control - they verify that your functions and classes behave as expected under different conditions.

## Why write tests?
- Catch bugs early before users find them
- Make sure your code still works after making changes
- Document how your code is supposed to work
- Give you confidence when refactoring or adding features

# ==========================================================================================================
# A Simple Project Without Tests
# ==========================================================================================================
Let's start with a basic calculator module to understand the problem tests solve:
"""
# calculator.py - A simple calculator without tests

def add(a, b):
    """Add two numbers together"""
    return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
    """Subtract b from a"""
    return a - b

def multiply(a, b):
    """Multiply two numbers"""
    return a * b

def divide(a, b):
    """Divide a by b"""
    return a / b

def calculate_discount(price, discount_percent):
    """Calculate price after applying discount percentage"""
    
    if discount_percent < 0 or discount_percent > 100:
        return price  # Invalid discount, return original price
    
    discount_amount = price * (discount_percent / 100)
    return price - discount_amount


# Manual testing (the old way)
# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     print("Manual testing:")
#     print(f"2 + 3 = {add(2, 3)}")  # Expected: 5
#     print(f"10 - 4 = {subtract(10, 4)}")  # Expected: 6
#     print(f"5 * 6 = {multiply(5, 6)}")  # Expected: 30
#     print(f"15 / 3 = {divide(15, 3)}")  # Expected: 5.0
#     print(f"$100 with 20% discount = ${calculate_discount(100, 20)}")  # Expected: 80.0

### Problems with manual testing:
# 1. You have to run the code manually every time
# 2. You might forget to test some functions
# 3. When you change code, you have to re-test everything manually
# 4. It's hard to test edge cases systematically
# 5. No easy way to know if all tests pass at a glance

## Output Explained:
‚úÖ .........
- Each . represents one successful test case.
- So ......... = 9 tests ran, all passed.

‚úÖ Ran 9 tests in 0.002s
- Exactly 9 test methods that start with test_ were discovered and executed.
- The whole test suite finished in 0.002 seconds.

‚úÖ OK
- All tests passed ‚Äî no errors, no failures, no skipped tests.
- This is exactly what you want to see


## What would failures look like?

If a test failed, you'd see something like this:

```

The F in place of a dot would indicate a failed test, and you'd get detailed output about what failed and why.

### Benefits of automated tests:
# 1. Fast: Run all tests with one command
# 2. Reliable: Tests run exactly the same way every time
# 3. Comprehensive: Easy to test many scenarios and edge cases
# 4. Confidence: Know immediately if changes break existing functionality
# 5. Documentation: Tests show how your code is meant to be used



r"""
# ==========================================================================================================
# Automatic Test Discovery
# ==========================================================================================================
Functions inside a `unittest.TestCase` class must start with `test_` in order to be automatically discovered 
and run as tests.

## Why `test_` is required
- The unittest framework uses naming conventions to detect which methods are tests. It:
    - Scans for any method in a subclass of `unittest.TestCase`
    - Runs only those whose names start with `test_`
- If you name your method anything else (like `check_addition()` or `verify_something()`), it will not be run automatically.

## üéØ ‚ÄúRun automatically‚Äù means:
When you execute your test file using Python (e.g., via `python test_calculator.py` or similar), 
the unittest framework will automatically discover and execute any method that:
    - Is inside a class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`
    - Has a name that starts with `test_`
You do not need to manually call those methods.


## Example ‚Äî Automatic vs Manual

‚úÖ Automatic test discovery
```
import unittest

class TestMath(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_add(self):
        self.assertEqual(1 + 2, 3)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

When you run this file (`python test_file.py`), the output will be:
```
.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 test in 0.000s

OK
```
Even though you did not call `test_add()` manually, Python found it and ran it for you ‚Äî that's what "automatically" means.

‚ùå What if method doesn't start with `test_`?
```
class TestMath(unittest.TestCase):
    def check_add(self):
        self.assertEqual(1 + 2, 3)
```

If you run the file, nothing will happen ‚Äî `unittest` ignores this method because it doesn't follow 
the `test_` naming convention:
```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 0 tests in 0.000s

OK
```
So: no error, but your test is silently skipped.


‚úÖ TL;DR:
‚ÄúAutomatically‚Äù means unittest will find and run test methods for you, as long as they're named starting 
with `test_`, without you needing to call them manually.

# ==========================================================================================================
# Understanding Test Structure
# ==========================================================================================================
Let's break down the anatomy of a test:
```
def test_add_positive_numbers(self):

    # A test method must:
    # 1. Start with 'test_' (so unittest can find it)
    # 2. Take 'self' as parameter (it's a class method)
    # 3. Have a descriptive name
    
    # ARRANGE: Set up test data
    number1 = 2
    number2 = 3
    expected_result = 5
    
    # ACT: Call the function being tested
    actual_result = add(number1, number2)
    
    # ASSERT: Check if the result is what we expected
    self.assertEqual(actual_result, expected_result)
```
This is called the AAA pattern:
    - Arrange: Set up your test data
    - Act: Execute the code(function) you're testing
    - Assert: Verify the results are correct

# ==========================================================================================================
# Common Assertion Methods
# ==========================================================================================================
unittest provides many assertion methods:
"""
class TestAssertionExamples(unittest.TestCase):
    
    def test_assertion_examples(self):

        self.assertNotEqual(add(2, 3), 6)
        
        # Check if something is True
        self.assertTrue(5 > 3)
        
        # Check if something is False

        # Check if a value is in a list
        self.assertIn(3, [1, 2, 3, 4])
        
        # Check floating point numbers (they can have tiny differences)

### Consider Using Subtests
Subtests make failures easier to debug when looping over similar cases:

        (100, 0, 100.0),

        with self.subTest(discount=discount):
            self.assertEqual(calculate_discount(price, discount), expected)
```


# ==========================================================================================================
# What Makes a Good Test?
# ==========================================================================================================
Good tests are:
    1. Independent: Each test should work on its own
    2. Repeatable: Should give same result every time
    3. Fast: Should run quickly
    4. Clear: Easy to understand what's being tested
    5. Focused: Test one specific behavior

Bad test example:
```
def test_everything_at_once(self):
    # DON'T DO THIS - tests too many things at once
    self.assertEqual(add(2, 3), 5)
    self.assertEqual(subtract(10, 5), 5)
    self.assertEqual(multiply(3, 4), 12)
    # If any one of these fails, you won't know which one without investigating
````

Good test examples:
```
def test_add_returns_correct_sum(self):
    # GOOD - tests one specific behavior clearly
    self.assertEqual(add(2, 3), 5)

def test_subtract_returns_correct_difference(self):
    # GOOD - separate test for separate behavior
    self.assertEqual(subtract(10, 5), 5)
```


# ==========================================================================================================
# How to Run the Tests from the Command Line
# ==========================================================================================================

After uncomment the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block

Option 1: Run from CLI
-----------------------
$ python test_file.py
# Example: python "Testing in Python/1_introduction.py"

Option 2: Run a specific class
------------------------------
$ python test_file.py TestEdgeCases
# Example: python "Testing in Python/1_introduction.py" TestEdgeCases

Option 3: Use unittest discovery
-------------------------------
$ python -m unittest discover

All tests must be named like `test_*.py` and reside in the same folder or a `tests/` subfolder.


# ==========================================================================================================
# When `unittest` Is Used in the Real World
# ==========================================================================================================
unittest is:
    - part of the Python standard library (no external dependencies)
    - robust and well-documented
    - compatible with most CI/CD tools
    - enough for many basic and intermediate testing needs

It's often used in:
    - small to medium-sized applications
    - internal tools and utilities
    - enterprise projects that prefer no third-party libraries
    - legacy codebases that started with unittest
    - educational and training materials (due to its built-in availability)

‚ùóÔ∏èBut... It's not always the first choice
In modern Python projects, many teams prefer more expressive and feature-rich test frameworks, such as:
| Tool                                        | Why it's often preferred                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`pytest`**                                | Less boilerplate, better output, fixtures, plugins, supports `unittest` tests too |
| **`nose2`**                                 | Successor to `nose`, supports `unittest`-style tests                              |
| **`hypothesis`**                            | Property-based testing ‚Äî generates test inputs automatically                      |

| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------  |
| ‚úÖ **Internal API at a bank**       | `unittest` for compliance, simplicity, and stability                 |
| ‚úÖ **IoT firmware testing**         | `unittest` for basic correctness checks                              |
| ‚úÖ **Data pipeline in Python**      | Started with `unittest`, added `pytest` later                        |
| ‚ùå **Large-scale SaaS web app**     | Usually uses `pytest` or a combo of `pytest + unittest.mock`         |
| ‚úÖ **Machine learning experiments** | Quick `unittest` or `pytest` test suites to verify training pipeline |

üß† So Should You Use It?
Yes, as a beginner or early-stage developer, using `unittest` is:
    - Totally professional
